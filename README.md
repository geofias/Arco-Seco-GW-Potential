# Groundwater Potential Zone (Arco Seco, Panama)
The Groundwater Potential Zone (GWPZ) project in Arco Seco, Panama, utilized advanced geospatial analysis through QGIS to identify and map areas with high potential for groundwater resources. The project aimed to support water resource management, agricultural planning, and sustainable development in the region by integrating multiple geographical and environmental factors.

The project considered the following key features:

‚Ä¢ Lithology: The geological composition of the region was assessed to determine areas with favorable rock types for groundwater storage and movement. This included evaluating the permeability and porosity of various rock formations.

‚Ä¢ Rainfall: Rainfall distribution data was integrated to understand the spatial variability in precipitation, a critical factor influencing groundwater recharge. The project used historical rainfall records to identify patterns and trends.

‚Ä¢ Drainage Density: This feature provided insights into the network of rivers, streams, and other drainage channels in the region. Areas with higher drainage density could indicate zones with increased surface runoff, affecting groundwater replenishment.

‚Ä¢ Land Use and Land Cover (LULC): The project's LULC analysis explored how different land uses (e.g., urban, agricultural, forested) impact groundwater recharge and extraction. It helped identify regions with natural cover conducive to groundwater accumulation.

‚Ä¢ Lineament Density: Lineaments are linear features on the landscape that may indicate underlying geological structures, such as faults or fractures. The project evaluated these structures' density and orientation to identify potential groundwater conduits.

‚Ä¢ Slope: The slope analysis highlighted the topographical variations in Arco Seco, with steeper slopes generally leading to higher surface runoff and less groundwater infiltration. This feature aided in identifying areas with favorable conditions for groundwater recharge.

By integrating these features in QGIS, the project generated a comprehensive map of groundwater potential zones in Arco Seco, indicating areas with the highest probability of groundwater availability. This map can serve as a valuable resource for local authorities, stakeholders, and environmental planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable water resource management and regional development.
